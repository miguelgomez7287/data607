#3 What each expression will match

<font size="2">

(.)\1\1 - Character repeated 3 times in a row.

(.)(.)\\2\\1 - 2 characters followed by the same 2 characters in reverse order.

(..)\1 - 2 characters repeated twice

(.).\\1.\\1 - A character repeated 3 times with characters in between each repetition. 

(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1 - 3 characters followed by 0 or more characters of any kind followed by the same 3 characters but in reverse order.
