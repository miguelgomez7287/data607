I decided to include a pie chart that breaks down the people killed by Race. Even though majority of the police killings occurred in neighborhoods that are poorer and blacker, 51% of the people killed were white.

This histograms shows the death rate by race and ethnicity for 2015-2022. The highest number of victims were white but we have to factor in US population. 

According to the census, the population estimate for 2021 was 332,031,554 people.

p<-ggplot(data=data2, aes(x=values, y=Race_ethnicity)) +

After calculating the distribution of deaths by Race and ethnicity from 2015-2021, we can see that black people get killed the most by police at a rate of 3.59 for every 100,000 while people get killed at a rate of 1.22 and Hispanic at 1.77.

I used janitorâ€™s tabyl() function to count how often each state shows up. tabyl also calculates the percentage.


```{r}

reactable(data2,bordered = TRUE, striped = TRUE,
          highlight = TRUE, filterable = TRUE,  showPageSizeOptions = TRUE,
          showPagination = TRUE, pageSizeOptions = c(10, 25,50),
          defaultPageSize = 10)

I decided to review and use the data set from the article  "Where Police Have Killed Americans In 2015" by Ben Casselman. This articles focuses on the demographic and economic information of the neighborhoods where these police killings occurred. 

Link:https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-police-have-killed-americans-in-2015/

The share_black column represents the share of population that is black (alone, not in combination).
The share_white column represents the share of population  that is non-Hispanic white.
The share_hispanic column shows represents the share of population that is Hispanic/Latino (any race).
The pov column shows the Tract-level poverty rate.

I'm using it to calculate share of population avg and Tract-level poverty rate avg by state



```{r}
data4<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/police-killings/police_killings.csv")
data4 <- na.omit(data4)

data4$share_hispanic_avg <- NA

Conclusion:

There is evidence to suggest that race/ethnicity and location can be factors that relate to or predict instances of police brutality. My analyses has found that certain racial groups and locations, particularly Black and Latinx communities, are more likely to be targeted and subjected to police violence than other groups.

Moreover, location can also play a role, with some regions or neighborhoods experiencing higher rates of police brutality than others. For example, areas with higher poverty rates or higher crime rates may have higher instances of police violence.

My study and others provide compelling evidence that race/ethnicity and location play a significant role in determining who experiences police brutality. However, it is important to note that police brutality is a complex issue, and there are many factors that contribute to it. It is not solely determined by race, but also by individual police officers' attitudes and behavior, as well as systemic issues within law enforcement and the criminal justice system as a whole.
